</ul>

3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
4. You will need to have an active <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com">IDX Broker</a> account for the Plugin to work. Once you do, go to the IDX Broker Plugin page within WordPress. Enter your CID, Password, and IDX Broker Subdomain and click the 'Save Changes' button.
5. Your plugin will now pull your IDX Broker account information into Wordpress. Use the IDX Broker Plugin Admin page to add Widgets, menu links, and neighborhood/subdivision landing pages (Custom Links), and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is IDX? =
Internet Data Exchange, or IDX, is a type of data feed provided by your MLS. This data feed typically (but not always) mirrors the data available on your MLS's website. IDX Broker&reg; connects to this data feed automatically, maps the necessary fields, and then adds forms, scripts, etc, giving you a way to add html links and widgets to you website(s). 

= Do I need an IDX Broker account in order to use this plugin? =
Yes. IDX Broker manages your IDX feed by building forms, results, and property details pages that match your website or blog design. All IDX feeds require approval from a local board or MLS. If you are not a member of a local board or MLS, or your MLS does not provide an IDX data feed, then you will be unable to add IDX Broker plugin functionality to your WordPress site. <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/idx_mls_coverage.php">Read more about our MLS coverage.</a> Note that some MLS's may charge you a separate fee for access to your IDX feed. 

= Does IDX Broker require a long-term contract? =
No. IDX Broker requires a month-to-month agreement only. There are three monthly account levels - Agent ($39+), Team ($49+), and Office($78+). 

= What can I expect if I decide to get my IDX feed through IDX Broker? =
When you sign up for a new account, IDX, Inc sends you any necessary MLS paperwork (if required). Once you have signed the necessary paperwork, you will need to fax that back to us and we will then forward your paperwork to the MLS for approval. Approval can take anywhere from 3-10 days. Once approved, we will activate your account, integrate your site's design into IDX pages, and send you IDX Broker login credentials so that you can add links and Widgets to your site or blog.  

= How many blogs/websites can I integrate with IDX Broker? =
Features provided by this Plugin - Widgets, links, and custom links may be placed onto any WordPress website or blog, regardless of MLS approval status. The reason for this is because all Widgets, links, and custom links point back to the original IDX-approved website. Each IDX Broker account requires MLS approval of ONE site for IDX display. Your search results and details pages must match this approved site. 

= Does IDX Broker offer lead capture functionality? =
Yes. IDX Broker provides you with a sign up Widget, sign up links, a lead manager page, a customizable sign up form, and provides you with 'teaser' registration options. 

= Does this plugin work with PHP4? =
No. The latest version of this plugin is optimized for WordPress 3.0 and as a result has been written in PHP5. Download the 1.2.6 version of the plugin if your web server uses PHP4.

Plugin has been streamlined and optimized after its initial development.  Wrapper features have updgraded were no file permissions, or copy and paste is needed in order to take advantage of the full integration feature.  Simply add your tags, set a few settings in the IDX Broker Admin, and your pages are automatically wrapped for you.  No need to update your wrapper, it's dyanamically loaded each time someone hits one of your pages.  The "Property Manager Signup" widget has been added, so that your visitor can sign up for automatic email updates that match searches that they preform on your site.  An essential upgrade!

= 1.2.7 =

Advanced feature now detects tags, read/write settings for folders, and provides copy/paste of header and footer content if security settings do not allow for the locally stored live wrapper files.

<strong>Important Note to Advanced Developers: If you currently use the live wrapper files, all updates will force you to manually modify the CHMOD settings for your /wrapper/ folder and the header.php and footer.php files contained there. Please review <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/questions/301/">this knowledgebase article</a> for more information about how to manage live wrappers when you update the IDX Broker plugin. Note that this is due to WordPress security requirements. This logic applies to any plugin that writes files to your local WordPress installation.
