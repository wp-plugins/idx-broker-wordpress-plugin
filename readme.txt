== Description ==

This IDX plugin is <strong>exclusively</strong> for IDX Broker clients. Please note that IDX, Inc. does not provide phone support to troubleshooot theme compatibility issues. This free plugin is being provided as a courtesy to the WordPress development community. 

This plugin offers four primary features. <strong>Note that these features may not be supported in every theme or WordPress installation</strong>:

1. Drag-and-drop quick search, iPhone app, showcase, slideshow, and other IDX Broker Widgets into your Automattic sidebar (Automattic sidebar may not be available for all themes).
2. Add MLS basic, advanced, map, address, and/or listing search to the navigation links at the top of your WordPress site or blog. 
3. Add an unlimited number of neighborhood, subdivision, or other custom IDX search pages to your navigation and/or sidebar.
4. <strong>Advanced Theme Developers Only:</strong> Provide Realtors&reg; with one-click Blog <> IDX synchronization. Tag your themes for Realtors&reg; so that Realtors&reg; don't have to update their IDX pages manually. 

Your IDX results and details pages are hosted by IDX Broker, not your Wordpress blog. This means that you will not need to hand-code or remember any WordPress tags in order to use this plugin. 

Most of your IDX lead capture, iPhone app settings, lead routing, listing email updates, etc. are to be managed using your IDX Broker Admin, not via Admin for this WordPress Plugin. We have chosen not to reproduce an entire IDX back-office solution within Wordpress. There are simply too many features available through hosted IDX that cannot be reproduced within WordPress. 

This Plugin is ideal for those Realtors&reg; who simply need to build a site or blog quickly in WordPress. It provides a way to quickly display featured listings, community/subdivision pages, basic search, your iPhone app code, and more - without having to hand-code this into every theme.     

<strong>Leading Features</strong>

Indexable IDX - All hosted IDX pages are fully indexable. We have removed duplicate titles and descriptions from most of your IDX results and details pages. We also provide you with a way to edit URL paths, add sub header content, custom title/description tags, and make your IDX pages unique. 

Custom Results Landing Pages - We recommend that you add custom content to the sub headers of your IDX results pages in order to encourage the search engines to differentiate your content from all the other IDX results and details pages that display the same addresses, Cities, and Zips for each MLS region. 

Lead Registration - You can use IDX Broker to force signup on every 4th or 5th property detail view. Or, if you prefer, require registration once the visitor click the link to your custom results page. 

Lead Management - Anybody who requests property info, fills out your contact form, saves a search, or creates an account with you will show up in the Lead Management tab of IDX Broker. You will also receive an email alert when this occurs. 

<strong>Getting Started</strong>

Existing IDX Broker clients may simply enter their IDX Broker Client ID (CID), Password, and IDX sub domain (mysite.idxco.com or <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/questions/270/">custom domain</a>) to get started. Once entered, simply follow the instructions provided on the plugin page, or review articles published to the <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/categories/Wordpress+Plugin/">IDX Broker Knowledgebase.</a>    

<strong>General Terms of Use</strong> 

This IDX plugin is supported by MLS/IDX feeds. This means that your MLS governs the IDX results and details pages. 

IDX, Inc. manages any MLS paperwork and IDX Broker will automatically display the correct MLS/IDX disclaimers to ensure compliance with the MLS(s) & Board(s) that provides you with your IDX feed. 

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract the IDX Broker plugin. You may also install directly by going to your WP-Admin page and then Plugins > Add New. Search for 'idxbroker' under new plugins and click to install directly.
2. Upload the uncompressed folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
4. You will need an IDX Broker account (MLS approval required), for the Plugin to work. Go to the IDX Broker Plugin page within WordPress. Enter your CID, Password, and IDX Broker Subdomain and click the 'Save Changes' button.
5. Your plugin will now pull your IDX Broker account information into Wordpress. Use the IDX Broker Plugin Admin page to add Widgets, menu links, and neighborhood/subdivision landing pages (Custom Links).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does IDX work? =
IDX is a type of data feed provided by your MLS. This data feed typically (but not always) mirrors the data available on your MLS's website. IDX Broker™ connects to this data feed automatically, maps the necessary fields, and adds forms, scripts, etc, giving you a way to add html links and widgets to you website(s). 

= How many blogs/websites can I integrate with IDX Broker? =
Features provided by this Plugin - Widgets, links, and custom links may be placed onto ANY WordPress website or blog, regardless of MLS approval status. The reason for this is because all Widgets, links, and custom links point back to the original IDX-approved website. 

Note that the website hosting the design for IDX pages must be approved by your local MLS(s).  

= Do I need an IDX Broker account in order to use this plugin? =

Yes. IDX Broker manages your IDX feed by building forms, results, and property details pages that match your website or blog design. All IDX feeds require approval from a local board or MLS. If you are not a member of a local board or MLS, or your MLS does not provide an IDX data feed, then you will be unable to add IDX Broker plugin functionality to your WordPress site. <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/idx_qanda.php">Read more about IDX Broker and IDX Feeds.</a>

= Should I use the advanced synchronization features, or leave that to my developer? =

We recommend that you leave the advanced synchronization feature to your developer. One exception to this rule is if you understand how WordPress manages security settings including CHMOD settings. If you don't know what CHMOD settings are, you should not attempt to synchronize your WordPress with IDX pages. Simply <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/contact.php">contact our support team</a> <strong>once you have finished making changes to your WordPress blog or site using the plugin</strong>, and we will update your IDX pages with those changes.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.2.7 =

Advanced feature now detects tags, read/write settings for folders, and provides copy/paste of header and footer content if security settings do not allow for the locally stored live wrapper files.

<strong>Important Note to Advanced Developers: If you currently use the live wrapper files, all updates will force you to manually modify the CHMOD settings for your /wrapper/ folder and the header.php and footer.php files contained there. Please review <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/questions/301/">this knowledgebase article</a> for more information about how to manage live wrappers when you update the IDX Broker plugin. Note that this is due to WordPress security requirements. This logic applies to any plugin that writes files to your local WordPress installation.
