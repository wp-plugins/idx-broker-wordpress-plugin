== Description ==

This IDX plugin provides Real Estate Brokers and Agents with a very easy way to add <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/features/Quick-Search">Quick Search</a>, <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/features/Automatically-Feature-Listings-for-an-Agent">Active Listings</a>, <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/features/Predefined-Subdivision">Pre-defined Search Links</a>, <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/features/Custom-Lead-Signup-Form">Lead Capture</a>, and more to any WordPress site or blog. 

This plugin requires an <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/">IDX Broker</a> subscriber account. Agent accounts start at $39.99 monthly and include features available via full IDX (lead capture, pre-defined links, indexable details pages, etc).   

Features include:

1. Drag-and-drop quick search, the myAgent iPhone app, showcases, slideshows, and lead login, and other IDX Broker Widgets for your Automattic sidebar.
2. Add featured, basic MLS search, advanced MLS search, map search, address search, and/or listing search to the navigation links at the top of your WordPress site or blog. 
3. Add an unlimited number of neighborhood, subdivision, or other custom IDX search pages to your navigation and/or sidebar.
4. <strong>Advanced Theme Developers Only:</strong> Provide Realtors&reg; with one-click Blog <> IDX synchronization. Combine this feature with a <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/questions/270/">custom subdomain</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/questions/57/">dynamic title</a> and description tags for advanced search engine optimization.  

Your blog posts and pages are hosted in WordPress (myblogsite.com). Your IDX Broker pages are hosted by IDX Broker (myblogsite.idxco.com or subdomain.myblogsite.com). We integrate the design of your blog site INTO your IDX pages so that all you need to do is add links and widgets that point to your IDX subdomain (or custom subdomain). By separating the IDX functions from your blogging functions, we are able to provide you with a very powerful administrative back-office application that controls listing details, lead activity, custom search links, agent bio pages, you iPhone App colors/details, and more.      

<strong>Benefits</strong>

Get Indexed - All IDX pages are fully indexable. We have removed duplicate titles and descriptions from most of your IDX results and details pages. We also provide you with a way to edit URL paths, add sub header content, custom title/description tags, and make your IDX pages unique. You can make your custom links as keyword and content-rich as you like. Yet even if you don't, your IDX pages are fully indexable. 

Benefit from long-tail keyword searches - Adding keyword-rich descriptions to the same page that hosts indexable IDX results means that you are pairing dynamic property content with unique neighborhood or area-specific content. The dynamic nature of these pages, and the fact that they aren't built with javascript or iFramed, encourages search engines to pair your keyword-rich page with specific 3, 4, and 5 word phrase searches.  

Get more leads, not just indexable pages - Through trial and error some realtors have been able to increase their weekly lead count by 200% or more. Try forcing signup on every 4th or 5th property detail view. Or, try another setting until you see a substantial increase in the number of weekly leads. You are in control. 

<strong>Getting Started</strong>

Existing IDX Broker clients may simply enter their IDX Broker Client ID (CID), Password, and IDX subdomain (mysite.idxco.com or <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/questions/270/">custom domain</a>) to get started. Once entered, simply follow the instructions provided on the plugin page, or review articles published to the <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/categories/Wordpress+Plugin/">IDX Broker Knowledgebase.</a>    

<strong>General Terms of Use</strong> 

This IDX plugin is supported by MLS/IDX feeds. This means that your MLS governs the IDX results and details pages. 

IDX, Inc. manages any MLS paperwork and IDX Broker will automatically display the correct MLS/IDX disclaimers to ensure compliance with the MLS(s) & Board(s) that provides you with your IDX feed. 

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract the IDX Broker plugin. You may also install directly by going to your WP-Admin page and then Plugins > Add New. Search for 'idxbroker' under new plugins and click to install directly.
2. Upload the uncompressed folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
4. You will need an IDX Broker account (MLS approval required), for the Plugin to work. Go to the IDX Broker Plugin page within WordPress. Enter your CID, Password, and IDX Broker Subdomain and click the 'Save Changes' button.
5. Your plugin will now pull your IDX Broker account information into Wordpress. Use the IDX Broker Plugin Admin page to add Widgets, menu links, and neighborhood/subdivision landing pages (Custom Links).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does IDX work? =
IDX is a type of data feed provided by your MLS. This data feed typically (but not always) mirrors the data available on your MLS's website. IDX Broker™ connects to this data feed automatically, maps the necessary fields, and adds forms, scripts, etc, giving you a way to add html links and widgets to you website(s). 

= How many blogs/websites can I integrate with IDX Broker? =
Features provided by this Plugin - Widgets, links, and custom links may be placed onto ANY WordPress website or blog, regardless of MLS approval status. The reason for this is because all Widgets, links, and custom links point back to the original IDX-approved website. 

Note that the website hosting the design for IDX pages must be approved by your local MLS(s).  

= Do I need an IDX Broker account in order to use this plugin? =

Yes. IDX Broker manages your IDX feed by building forms, results, and property details pages that match your website or blog design. All IDX feeds require approval from a local board or MLS. If you are not a member of a local board or MLS, or your MLS does not provide an IDX data feed, then you will be unable to add IDX Broker plugin functionality to your WordPress site. <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/idx_qanda.php">Read more about IDX Broker and IDX Feeds.</a>

= Should I use the advanced synchronization features, or leave that to my developer? =

We recommend that you leave the advanced synchronization feature to your developer. One exception to this rule is if you understand how WordPress manages security settings including CHMOD settings. If you don't know what CHMOD settings are, you should not attempt to synchronize your WordPress with IDX pages. Simply <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/contact.php">contact our support team</a> <strong>once you have finished making changes to your WordPress blog or site using the plugin</strong>, and we will update your IDX pages with those changes.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.2.7 =

Advanced feature now detects tags, read/write settings for folders, and provides copy/paste of header and footer content if security settings do not allow for the locally stored live wrapper files.

<strong>Important Note to Advanced Developers: If you currently use the live wrapper files, all updates will force you to manually modify the CHMOD settings for your /wrapper/ folder and the header.php and footer.php files contained there. Please review <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/support/kb/questions/301/">this knowledgebase article</a> for more information about how to manage live wrappers when you update the IDX Broker plugin. Note that this is due to WordPress security requirements. This logic applies to any plugin that writes files to your local WordPress installation.
