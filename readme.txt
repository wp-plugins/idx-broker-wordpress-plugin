== Description ==

This plugin is exclusively for IDX Broker Clients. It accomplishes three things:

1. Easily drag and drop every IDX Broker Widget into your Wordpress theme.
2. Easily add IDX links to your menu.
3. Easily display any neighborhood or subdivision (any custom link) landing pages that you've created using IDX Broker.
4. Once you have created the look and functionality that you want, syncing your page wrapper to IDX is as easy as a single button click with automatic wrapper creation.

Your IDX results and details pages are hosted by IDX Broker, not your Wordpress blog. As a result, the IDX results and details pages display automated. This will save you both time and effort. 

Getting Started

Existing IDX Broker clients may simply enter their IDX Broker client ID and IDX subdomain to get started. New IDX Broker clients will receive the required client ID and subdomain in a welcome email.

Indexable Listings

All hosted IDX pages are fully indexable. We have removed duplicate titles and descriptions from most of your IDX results and  details pages, and provide you with IDX Broker tools that will make those titles and descriptions update automatically via MLS data. You are also able to customize some URLs, titles, and descriptions to match your keyword strategy. 

Custom Results Landing Pages

We recommend that you add custom content to the subheaders of your IDX results pages in order to encourage the search enginess to differentiate your content from all the other IDX results and details pages that display the same addresses, Cities, and Zips for each MLS region. 

Lead Registration 

You can use IDX Broker to force signup on every 4th or 5th property detail view. Or, if you prefer, require registration once the visitor click the link to your custom results page. 

Lead Management

Anybody who requests property info, fills out your contact form, saves a search, or creates an account with you will show up in the Lead Management tab of IDX Broker. You will also receive an email alert when this occurs.    

General Terms of Use 

This IDX plugin is supported by MLS/IDX feeds. This means that your MLS governs the IDX results and details pages. 

IDX, Inc. manages any MLS paperwork and IDX Broker will automatically display the correct MLS/IDX disclaimers to ensure compliance with the MLS(s) & Board(s) that provides you with your IDX feed. 

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract the IDX Broker plugin. You may also install directly by going to your WP-Admin page and then Plugins > Add New. Search for 'idxbroker' under new plugins and click to install directly.
2. Upload the uncompressed folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
4. You will need an IDX Broker account (MLS approval required), for the Plugin to work. Go to the IDX Broker Plugin page within WordPress. Enter your CID, Password, and IDX Broker Subdomain and click the 'Save Changes' button.
5. Your plugin will now pull your IDX Broker account information into Wordpress. Use the IDX Broker Plugin Admin page to add Widgets, menu links, and neighborhood/subdivision landing pages (Custom Links).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does IDX work? =
IDX is a type of data feed provided by your MLS. This data feed typically (but not always) mirrors the data available on your MLS's website. IDX Broker™ connects to this data feed automatically, maps the necessary fields, and adds forms, scripts, etc, giving you a way to add html links and widgets to you website(s). 

= How many blogs/websites can I integrate with IDX Broker? =
Each IDX Broker account can be tied to a single website design. That may be this blog, or your corporate site, or your personal site. It's up to your as a Realtor&reg;. Note that the website hosting the design for IDX pages must be approved by your local MLS(s). IDX, Inc will manage that verification process for you. 

Features provided by this Plugin are an exception - Widgets, links, and custom links may be placed onto ANY WordPress website or blog, regardless of MLS approval. The reason for this is because all Widgets, links, and custom links point back to the original IDX-approved website. 

= Do I need an IDX Broker account in order to use this plugin? =

Yes. IDX Broker manages your IDX feed by building forms, results, and property details pages that match your website or blog design. All IDX feeds require approval from a local board or MLS. If you are not a member of a local board or MLS, or your MLS does not provide an IDX data feed, then you will be unable to add IDX Broker plugin functionality to your WordPress site. <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/idx_qanda.php">Read more about IDX Broker and IDX Feeds.</a>
