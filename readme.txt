== Description ==

Exclusively for IDX Broker Clients. Existing IDX Broker clients may simply enter an IDX Broker client ID and IDX Sub-domain to get started. New IDX Broker clients will receive the required client ID in a welcome email.

Below are a few benefits:
•	Easy to Implement - Drag and drop IDX link and quick search form widgets into your theme’s left or right nav. 
•	Branded Results – Design integrated Results and Details pages always match the branding of your blog or corporate site. 
•	Tremendous Value – Your current IDX Broker account provides you with full access to the Widget.  You do not have to purchase an additional product to access this plugin.
•	Largest MLS Coverage – With over 350+ MLS’s data sets covered through our system, we probably have your area already covered.  If not, we are happy to add it for no additional cost.
•	Powerful SEO – You can own the domain URL that hosts every IDX search, results, and details page. Every details page includes dynamic title and meta tag variables that you only have to setup once for ALL property pages! Or..more than once for testing your SEO theories. SEO is very often about trial and error.  
•	Integration is Easier - No hand-coding or hand-styling results and details. We wrap your site design once.
•	More Tools and Resources – This widget is supported exclusively by IDX Broker. CSS controls, iPhone apps, custom subdomains, custom landing pages, lead management, email updates and much more are all available to active subscribers.

This IDX plugin is supported by MLS/IDX feeds. This means that your MLS governs the results and details. We handle all the paperwork and automatically display the correct MLS/IDX disclaimers to ensure that you don’t get into trouble with the MLS & Board that provides you with your IDX feed.
