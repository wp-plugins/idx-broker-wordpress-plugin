== Description ==

This plugin is exclusively for IDX Broker Clients. It accomplishes three things:

1. Easily drag and drop every IDX Broker Widget into your Wordpress theme.
2. Easily add IDX links to your menu.
3. Easily display any neighborhood or subdivision (any custom link) landing pages that you've created using IDX Broker. 

Your IDX results and details pages are hosted by IDX Broker, not your Wordpress blog. As a result, the IDX results and details pages display automated. This will save you both time and effort. 

Getting Started

Existing IDX Broker clients may simply enter their IDX Broker client ID and IDX subdomain to get started. New IDX Broker clients will receive the required client ID and subdomain in a welcome email.

Indexable Listings

All hosted IDX pages are fully indexable. We have removed duplicate titles and descriptions from most of your IDX results and  details pages, and provide you with IDX Broker tools that will make those titles and descriptions update automatically via MLS data. You are also able to customize some URLs, titles, and descriptions to match your keyword strategy. 

Custom Results Landing Pages

We recommend that you add custom content to the subheaders of your IDX results pages in order to encourage the search enginess to differentiate your content from all the other IDX results and details pages that display the same addresses, Cities, and Zips for each MLS region. 

Lead Registration 

You can use IDX Broker to force signup on every 4th or 5th property detail view. Or, if you prefer, require registration once the visitor click the link to your custom results page. 

Lead Management

Anybody who requests property info, fills out your contact form, saves a search, or creates an account with you will show up in the Lead Management tab of IDX Broker. You will also receive an email alert when this occurs.    

General Terms of Use 

This IDX plugin is supported by MLS/IDX feeds. This means that your MLS governs the IDX results and details pages. 

IDX, Inc. manages any MLS paperwork and IDX Broker will automatically display the correct MLS/IDX disclaimers to ensure compliance with the MLS(s) & Board(s) that provides you with your IDX feed.
